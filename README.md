## Installation

```
npm i dotenv, npm i mysql, npm i inquirer, npm i console.table

```

## Usage 
------

Install all dependencies and run node index on your command line


## Challenges
------

The biggest challenges that I faced, which some are still resolved, are the proper usage of the sql statement and the understanding of joins. Choosing the right method to add employees and updating employee's roles within the database were the hardest one of all since I cannot figure out the proper and practical way to do it. Promises and async await method were used to patch some of the codes but it still leave some of the feature of this app unfunctional. In the near future, i hope to fix this code and makes it fully functional.
